I am Rasool Ferasat, PhD in Sport Biomechanics, with over ten years of academic and research experience in human motion analysis. My expertise focuses on gait analysis, core stability, electromyography (EMG), kinetics, and kinematics.

My doctoral research investigated gait biomechanics and EMG patterns of core stability muscles, comparing trained and sedentary individuals. My work integrates biomechanics, injury prevention, and performance optimization in both sports and clinical settings.

I currently teach Sport Biomechanics, Human Anatomy, and Pathomechanics of Human Movement at the undergraduate and graduate levels. I am also co-founder of a health and sport rehabilitation center, where biomechanical assessment and movement analysis are applied to injury prevention and rehabilitation.

My research interests include:
- Human Motion Biomechanics 
- Gait Analysis 
- Core Stability and EMG 
- Sports Injury Prevention 
- Kinetics and Kinematics 

I am actively seeking international research collaborations and postdoctoral opportunities in human movement science.
